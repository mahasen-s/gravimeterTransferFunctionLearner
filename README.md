# Transfer Function Learner
Learning the transfer function of a atom-interferometer gravimeter (treated as a black-box system) using DNNs.

`./matlab` contains code for preprocessing raw experimental data. (`./matlab/process_campagin4.m`) shows the whole process.

`./python` contains the python notebooks for prototyping the DNN model. The topology of the network and the theory behind the models are detailed extensively in `./python/transferFunctionLearner_groundTruthTest_optimise.ipynb`
